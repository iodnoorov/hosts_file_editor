# Simple Hosts File editor

----
Just simple pet project for learning python and Qt6.

## Implemented functionality

1. Simple GUI with pyQt6
2. Adding new urls to hosts file (with 127.0.0.1)

## Plans

- Add checkup for input text (must be url)
- Add manual IP address adding
- Work with comments (adding, reading)
- Linux and macOS builds.
- Need to do checks for hosts file's folder, not only in standard folders. (For all OS)
- Add functionality to read, modify and delete sites in hosts file
- Think about crontab and adding/deleting rules in workhours (manually adding rules)
- Tests-tests-tests
