# Simple Hosts File editor

Just simple pet project for learning python and Qt6.

## Implemented functionality

### Release 0.1

1. Simple GUI with pyQt6
2. Adding new urls to hosts file (with 127.0.0.1)

### Release 0.2
1. URL validation
2. Manual adding custom IP address (if blank its add 127.0.0.1 by default)

## Plans
- Refactor to OOP and MVC pattern (It's not necessary to use MVC and OOP here, but for learning purposes)
- ~~Add checkup for input text (must be url)~~
- ~~Add manual IP address adding~~
- Work with comments (adding, reading)
- Linux and macOS builds.
- Need to do checks for hosts file's folder, not only in standard folders. (For all OS)
- Add functionality to read, modify and delete sites in hosts file
- Think about crontab and adding/deleting rules in workhours (manually adding rules)
- Tests-tests-tests
